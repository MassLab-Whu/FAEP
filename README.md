Now, we only provide the details of the experimental part of the paper here. Our code will be released in the future.

This is the experimental results of further comparison with state-of-the-art method FUEL in more complex scenarios. (a), (b), and (c) correspond to office(30x20x2 m^3), pillar(28x14x2 m^3), and bridge(18x10x5 m^3) scenario respectively (the red and blue trajectories in them represent the performance of the proposed method and FUEL at the same initial position.). (d), (e), and (f) respectively illustrate the coverage performance of four comparative experiments in three different scenarios. (g), (h), and (i) respectively show the specific distribution of flight time, flight distance, and coverage in the experimental results of the two methods in three different scenarios.
